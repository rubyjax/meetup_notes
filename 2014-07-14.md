Meetup Notes

Greetings Rubyists,

Last week we had a great time at the Starfield office. Trevor Little did an exellent job delivering his talk titled "The Quest for the Right Abstraction". He explained a very difficult problem by using simple, coherent slides and real world examples. I felt his delivery, pace and attitude of made it easy for me understand, relate and connect to the topic. Well done Trevor, well Done! We look forward to hearing more from you. 

Also, let's give a shoutout to the starfield office for hosting the meetup last night. It's a great space.

So, coming up next we have the RubyJax OpenHacks at Starbucks at the beach.
